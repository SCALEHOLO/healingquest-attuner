# Project Audit Report

## 1. File and Folder Structure

**Top-level folders:**

- `src/` — Main application source code.
  - `src/app/` — Next.js app directory (pages, layouts, routes).
  - `src/components/` — Reusable React components.
  - `src/contexts/` — React context providers (e.g., Auth).
  - `src/data/` — Static data (e.g., quiz questions).
  - `src/lib/` — Library code (e.g., Firebase config).
  - `src/services/` — Business logic/services (e.g., quiz logic).
- `public/` — Static assets (images, SVGs, videos, etc.).
- `cline_jsons/` — Project-specific JSONs and audit artifacts.

**Key files:**

- `package.json` — Project manifest, dependencies, scripts.
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration.
- `tailwind.config.ts` — Tailwind CSS configuration.
- `next.config.ts` — Next.js configuration.
- `eslint.config.mjs` — ESLint configuration.
- `README.md` — Project overview.
- `.gitignore` — Git ignore rules.

## 2. Dependencies

**Dependencies:**

- `firebase@^11.10.0` — Used for Firestore, Auth, Analytics.
- `next@15.3.5` — Next.js framework (latest major version).
- `react@^19.0.0`, `react-dom@^19.0.0` — React core.

**DevDependencies:**

- `@eslint/eslintrc@^3`
- `@types/node@^20`
- `@types/react@^19`
- `@types/react-dom@^19`
- `autoprefixer@^10.4.21`
- `eslint@^9`
- `eslint-config-next@15.3.5`
- `tailwindcss@^3.4.17`
- `typescript@^5`

**Notes:**

- All dependencies are current and compatible with Node 18+ and Next.js 15.
- No deprecated or suspicious packages detected.
- All packages in use; no unused dependencies found.

## 3. Core Functionality

- **Application Purpose:**  
  This is a Next.js web application that delivers a personality/insight quiz. Users answer a series of questions, receive a category-based score, and get personalized feedback. Results are saved to Firebase Firestore and also used for lead generation.

- **Quiz Logic:**  
  - Questions are hardcoded in `src/data/quizQuestions.ts`.
  - Scoring logic is in `src/services/quizService.ts` (`calculateScores`).
  - Quiz state and responses are managed in the app and saved via `saveIndividualResponse` and `saveQuizResults`.
  - Result interpretation (personalized insight) is handled by `getPersonalizedInsight`.

- **Firebase Usage:**  
  - Firestore is used for persisting quiz results and leads.
  - Firebase config is in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.

## 4. Dynamic vs Static Logic

- **Quiz questions are hardcoded** in a TypeScript array (`src/data/quizQuestions.ts`).
- No dynamic loading from JSON, Firebase, or external sources.

## 5. Areas Requiring Attention

- **TODOs:**  
  - `src/lib/firebase.ts` contains a TODO to add more Firebase SDKs as needed.
- **Placeholders:**  
  - Input placeholders in login forms are standard and not an issue.
- **Commented-out code:**  
  - Some commented-out imports in `src/app/page.tsx` (not critical).
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Error handling is present in async functions, with errors logged and, in some cases, not thrown to avoid disrupting user flow.
- **Responsive Design & Accessibility:**  
  - Tailwind CSS is used, which supports responsive design. Accessibility not explicitly audited, but standard React/Next.js practices are followed.

## 6. Build & Execution

- **NPM Scripts:**
  - `dev` — `next dev --turbopack`
  - `build` — `next build`
  - `start` — `next start`
  - `lint` — `next lint`
- **Compatibility:**
  - Next.js 15.3.5 is used (latest major).
  - Node version not specified in package.json, but all dependencies are compatible with Node 18+.

## 7. Potential Issues

- **Missing Environment Files:**  
  - No `.env.local` or similar environment files found. If Firebase credentials or other secrets are required, ensure they are provided in deployment.
- **Dependency Misconfigurations:**  
  - None detected.
- **Unused Packages:**  
  - None detected.
- **Import Path Consistency:**  
  - Both alias (`@/`) and relative imports are used consistently.
- **Other:**  
  - No major issues detected in the current codebase.

Task Completed

The audit task is complete. A comprehensive markdown report was generated at report.md, covering:

- File and folder structure with purposes and key files
- All dependencies and devDependencies, with notes on their status
- Core application functionality, including quiz logic, Firebase usage, and result interpretation
- Confirmation that quiz questions are hardcoded (static logic)
- Areas requiring attention, including TODOs and error handling
- Build and execution details, including npm scripts and compatibility
- Potential issues, such as missing environment files and import path consistency

The report is clean, structured, and ready to be shared with the development team.

### Completed Tasks 07-26-2025

#### JHopkins - Developer

**tasks_json_reports_md/report.md**
Task Completed
The scoring logic for the HOLO Healing Quest quiz has been implemented in src/services/calculateScores.ts. The function:

- Accepts a response object mapping question IDs to values.
- References question categories from src/data/quizQuestions.ts.
- Maps quiz categories to the 8 attunement categories (mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, environmental, social, financial, creative).
- Accumulates and averages values per category, scaling the final score to a 0–10 range.
- Returns an object with all 8 categories, defaulting to 0 for any with no responses.
- Includes detailed logging of raw totals, counts, and normalized values for each category.
- Handles missing question IDs and unmapped categories gracefully, logging warnings and skipping them.

This implementation meets all requirements specified in tasks_json_reports_md/calculateScores_logging.json.

**harmony_engine.json**
The HarmonyEngine module has been implemented in src/services/HarmonyEngine.ts. This module:

- Accepts an object with 8 attunement scores (mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, environmental, social, financial, creative), each     between 0–10.
- Identifies the dominant (highest) and weakest (lowest) categories.
- Returns an object with { dominantCategory, weakestCategory, insight, theme }.
- Provides a rule-based insight message and a theme string based on the dominant category.
- Logs the input vector and the computed dominant/weakest categories for debugging.
- Handles missing or malformed input gracefully, defaulting to generic values if needed.

This fulfills all requirements specified in tasks_json_reports_md/harmony_engine.json.

**dynamic_radar.json**
The HoloboidRadarChart component has been implemented in src/components/HoloboidRadarChart.tsx. This component:

- Accepts a required `scores` prop (object with 8 attunement categories, 0–10), and optional `themeColor`, `exportRef`, and `highlightDominant`.
- Uses react-chartjs-2 and chart.js to render an animated, responsive 8-axis radar chart.
- Applies TailwindCSS for layout, mobile responsiveness, and dark mode support.
- Highlights the dominant category if enabled.
- Provides robust error handling: if `scores` is missing or malformed, a clear fallback error message is displayed.
- Exposes an exportRef for PNG export (bonus feature).
- All requirements from tasks_json_reports_md/dynamic_radar.json are fulfilled.

**firebase_quiz.json**
Task Completed

The Firebase quiz submission and score saving logic has been implemented in src/services/saveResults.ts. The function:

- Accepts userId, email, responses, scores, and HarmonyEngine output (insightData).
- Persists all required fields to the Firestore quizResults collection, using userId as the document ID if provided, or an auto-generated ID otherwise.
- Stores: timestamp, email, responses, scores, dominantCategory, weakestCategory, insight, and theme.
- Optionally saves to the leads collection if lead capture is enabled.
- Catches and logs Firestore write errors, returning a boolean success indicator.

This fulfills all requirements in tasks_json_reports_md/firebase_quiz.json.

**harmony_engine_insights.json**
Task Completed

The HarmonyInsight component has been implemented in src/components/HarmonyInsight.tsx. This component:

- Receives required props: dominantCategory (string) and insight (string), with optional weakestCategory, theme, tone, and callToAction.
- Renders a styled section with a header, insight text, badges for dominant/weakest categories, and an optional call-to-action button.
- Uses TailwindCSS for layout, color, and responsiveness.
- Animates entrance with a fade-in-up effect (utility class provided for global CSS).
- Applies the dominant category color or theme color, with a neutral fallback.
- Handles missing required props by rendering nothing.

This fulfills all requirements in tasks_json_reports_md/harmony_engine_insight.json.
