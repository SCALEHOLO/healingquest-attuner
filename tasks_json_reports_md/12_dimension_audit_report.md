# 12-Dimension Audit Report

**Task:** Audit Rita's questionnaire work for Brooks’s requested schema

**Summary as of 2025-07-26**

---

## 1. 12 Dimensions in quizQuestions.ts

- **Current State:**  
  Only 4 categories are present: `holistic`, `integration`, `consciousness`, `resonance`.
  There are 8 questions, each mapped to one of these 4 categories.
- **Brooks’s Schema Requires:**  
  12 dimensions: Mental, Emotional, Professional, Physical, Spiritual, Financial, Relational, Environmental, Holistic, Integration, Consciousness, Resonance.
- **Conclusion:**  
  The 12-dimension format is **not implemented**. The code is still using the original 4-category/8-question system.

---

## 2. Multiple-Choice Mappings (1–4 scores)

- **Current State:**  
  No multiple-choice mapping logic is present. All responses are assumed to be numeric (1–5 scale).
- **Brooks’s Schema Requires:**  
  Multiple-choice questions with explicit option-to-score mapping (A–D mapped to 4–1).
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Not implemented.** No code for mapping MC options to scores.

---

## 3. Longform Responses or Notes

- **Current State:**  
  No logic for processing longform responses or qualitative notes.
- **Brooks’s Schema Requires:**  
  Support for longform/qualitative responses and optional notes per answer.
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Not implemented.**

---

## 4. Firestore Submission Structure

- **Current State:**  
  Firestore submission includes:
  - `email`, `timestamp`
  - `responses`: Record<questionId, number>
  - `scores`: Record<category, number>
  - `insightData` (dominantCategory, weakestCategory, insight, theme)
  - No `overall_average`, no `totals` object with 12 dimensions, no raw `responses[]` array as in Brooks’s schema.
- **Brooks’s Schema Requires:**  
  Submission of:
  - Raw `responses[]` array (with dimension, question, response_type, value, score, notes)
  - `totals` object (with all 12 dimensions)
  - `overall_average`
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Not implemented.** Still based on the original 4/8-category system.

---

## 5. System Basis

- **Current State:**  
  The system is still based on the original 4-category/8-question structure, with scoring logic for 8 attunement categories (but only 4 used).
- **Brooks’s Schema Requires:**  
  Full 12-dimension support, with extensible response types and richer data model.
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Not migrated.** Rita’s work is still on the old system.

---

## Where Rita Left Off

- The codebase is still using the original 4-category/8-question system.
- No evidence of migration to the 12-dimension schema.
- No multiple-choice mapping, longform, or notes support.
- Firestore structure does not match Brooks’s requested schema.

---

**Next Steps to Complete Migration:**

1. Expand `quizQuestions.ts` to cover all 12 dimensions with appropriate questions.
2. Update scoring logic to handle all 12 dimensions and support multiple-choice and longform responses.
3. Update Firestore submission to match Brooks’s schema (raw responses[], totals, overall_average, notes).
4. Refactor front-end and back-end as needed for new data model.
