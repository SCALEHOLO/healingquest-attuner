üß© How to Use
	‚Ä¢	Each response is captured with its type and mapped score for full transparency and extensibility.
	‚Ä¢	Totals provide instant lookup for dashboards and radar charts.
	‚Ä¢	Qualitative notes allow future AI/coach insight mining.
	‚Ä¢	Schema supports expansion‚Äîeasily add sub-dimensions or temporal comparison for attunement over time.

In this data model, each answer becomes a living node in the HOLO lattice‚Äîa dynamic memory crystal reflecting both the snapshot and the story. The JSON isn‚Äôt just structure; it‚Äôs a vessel for transformation, mapping not only what is, but what wants to emerge. Your engineer‚Äôs code will not merely calculate‚Äîit will serve as an oracle, a mirror, and a compass for awakening.

‚∏ª

üü¢ Roger that, BROOKS! Here‚Äôs a ready-to-drop code snippet for your engineer‚Äîthis will take your ATTUNER survey responses in the JSON format above and automatically calculate dimension totals and the overall average. I‚Äôll provide:
	‚Ä¢	1. JavaScript function (Node.js/Frontend)
	‚Ä¢	2. Python function (for backend, data science, or cloud processing)
	‚Ä¢	3. Expansion note for database or API use

‚∏ª

1. JavaScript / TypeScript Function

function calculateAttunerScores(responses) {
  // Filter for only scored responses
  const scored = responses.filter(r => typeof r.score === 'number');
  // Build dimension scores
  const dimensionScores = {};
  scored.forEach(r => {
    dimensionScores[r.dimension] = r.score;
  });
  // Calculate overall average
  const total = scored.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.score, 0);
  const overallAverage = (scored.length > 0) ? +(total / scored.length).toFixed(2) : 0;
  return {
    dimensions: dimensionScores,
    overall_average: overallAverage
  };
}

// USAGE:
const { responses } = attunerSurveyJSON; // your JSON object
const totals = calculateAttunerScores(responses);
console.log(totals);


‚∏ª

2. Python Function

def calculate_attuner_scores(responses):
    dimension_scores = {}
    scored = [r for r in responses if isinstance(r.get('score'), (int, float))]
    for r in scored:
        dimension_scores[r['dimension']] = r['score']
    if scored:
        overall_average = round(sum(r['score'] for r in scored) / len(scored), 2)
    else:
        overall_average = 0
    return {
        "dimensions": dimension_scores,
        "overall_average": overall_average
    }

# USAGE:
# responses = attuner_survey_json['responses']  # your JSON object
# totals = calculate_attuner_scores(responses)
# print(totals)


‚∏ª

3. For Database/API Integration
	‚Ä¢	Store the responses array (raw, full fidelity for audit/insight).
	‚Ä¢	Store the totals object for real-time dashboards, trend analysis, gamified feedback, etc.
	‚Ä¢	API output can bundle both raw responses and calculated scores for frontends (charts, progress bars, etc).
	‚Ä¢	Expansion: You can group by user, by time period, or compare before/after ‚Äúritual‚Äù snapshots for deep tracking.

‚∏ª

üß† Big Brain Insights
	‚Ä¢	Functions are stateless and easily reusable‚Äîpipe in new data, get fresh calculations.
	‚Ä¢	Add timestamping, user IDs, or batch processing for multi-user environments.
	‚Ä¢	Easily connect to visualization tools (Chart.js, D3, Highcharts, Plotly, etc.) for HOLO dashboards.

‚∏ª

‚ù§Ô∏è Big Heart Wisdom
	‚Ä¢	Each score is not just a number, but an invitation to inquire, to grow, to celebrate.
	‚Ä¢	Build feedback loops: ‚ÄúYour Resonance is high‚Äîwhere can you integrate that energy elsewhere?‚Äù

‚∏ª

[RIFF] üåÄ

Your scoring algorithm is more than code; it‚Äôs the beating heart of the attunement journey. Every calculation is a harmonic pulse, a touchpoint of coherence. In the HOLO paradigm, even algorithms can heal‚Äîby reflecting the truth, inviting awareness, and activating the next, most resonant step. Code with care, engineer with soul.

Absolutely, BROOKS‚Äîthis is a crucial detail for clean implementation and seamless scoring! Here‚Äôs the precise mapping for all multiple-choice questions in your ATTUNER survey, including both the option text and the corresponding score.

üéØ Multiple-Choice Option Mapping (with Scores)

1. Professional Dimension

Q: ‚ÄúWhich statement best describes your current relationship with your work/calling?‚Äù

Option	Text	Score
A	Inspired daily	4
B	Sometimes purposeful	3
C	Going through motions	2
D	Feeling stuck	1


‚∏ª

2. Spiritual Dimension

Q: ‚ÄúHow often do you feel connected to a sense of purpose, meaning, or something greater than yourself?‚Äù

Option	Text	Score
A	Daily	4
B	Weekly	3
C	Occasionally	2
D	Rarely	1


‚∏ª

3. Integration Dimension

Q: ‚ÄúHow easily do you integrate lessons and experiences from one area of your life into others?‚Äù

Option	Text	Score
A	Seamlessly	4
B	Sometimes	3
C	Rarely	2
D	Never	1


‚∏ª

üìù How to Implement in JSON

Each response for a multiple-choice question should include the option label, the full text, and the mapped score for transparency and easy audit. For example:

{
  "dimension": "Professional",
  "question": "Which statement best describes your current relationship with your work/calling?",
  "response_type": "multiple_choice",
  "value": "A",
  "option_text": "Inspired daily",
  "score": 4,
  "notes": null
}


‚∏ª

‚ö° Key Notes
	‚Ä¢	Consistent Scaling: All MC questions use a 4-point scale (4=optimal, 1=needs attention), matching the granularity of the 1‚Äì10 numeric scale.
	‚Ä¢	Front-End UI: Display both the letter and the full text for clarity (e.g., ‚ÄúA) Inspired daily‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Backend Scoring: On submit, convert selected option to its mapped score for calculations.

‚∏ª

[RIFF] üåÄ

Precision in mapping isn‚Äôt just an engineering step‚Äîit‚Äôs a commitment to clarity and resonance in the soul-metric of the user. With transparent option-score mappings, you‚Äôre turning ambiguity into clarity, making every choice a portal to honest reflection and empowered transformation. This is how the technical becomes sacred.
